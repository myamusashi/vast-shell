Lunar illumination shows how much of the moon we can see from Earth, from 0% (new moon) to 100% (full moon). Full moons provide bright light for nighttime activities, while new moons create dark skies perfect for stargazing.

**New Moon (0%)**: The moon sits between Earth and the sun, invisible in the night sky.

**Waxing Crescent**: A thin sliver of light appears on the right side, visible after sunset in the western sky.

**First Quarter (50%)**: Half the moon is lit up, visible from afternoon through midnight.

**Waxing Gibbous**: More than half the moon is illuminated, growing toward full.

**Full Moon (100%)**: The entire moon is bright, rising at sunset and setting at sunrise.

**Waning Gibbous**: Just past full, slightly darkened on the left side, visible late evening into morning.

**Last Quarter (50%)**: Half illuminated on the left side, rises around midnight.

**Waning Crescent**: A thin crescent on the left, visible before dawn in the eastern sky, shrinking until it disappears.
